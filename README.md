# Arduino-Ethernet-Shield-Projects
These are some of my personally designed ethernet shield-based projects. These serve as references for creating projects that require webpages and their links to controlling arduino I/O's. Each individual project has a schematic that goes along with it. The names will be the same.

Usage: 
- Upload any of the .INO Arduino projects to any Arduino board keeping in mind the CS pin of your shield 
- These projects were designed in mind with the Wiznet W5100 chipset. This is a 100Mbit ethenet shield with MicroSD card slot
- There is examples of displaying data and taking input from a webpage button
